## 🔧 New features

### Benchmark your tests

You can now measure the runtime of any test using the new `bench` feature. If a test exceeds your expected threshold, use the `max_ms` option to mark it as failed.

::: code-group
```bash [Example]
# @bench max_ms=10
function test_should_be_fast() {
  sleep 0.01
}
```
```[Output]
✗ Failed: test_should_be_fast (Expected < 10ms, got 11ms)
```
:::

### Placeholder support in snapshots

Ignore dynamic values in your snapshots using placeholders like `{{ignore}}`. This makes tests stable even when parts of the output vary between runs.

::: code-group
```bash [Example]
function test_snapshot_with_placeholder() {
  echo "ID: 12345" | assert_match_snapshot --ignore "{{ignore}}"
}
```
```[Snapshot]
ID: {{ignore}}
```
:::

### Count data providers accurately

`helper::find_total_tests` now includes cases provided by `@data_provider`, giving a more accurate count of total executed tests.

## 🐛 Bugfix

### Parallel mode stability

Fixes were applied to ensure parallel mode works consistently across platforms, including improved detection on Windows and consistent execution on `arch64`.

::: code-group
```bash [Example]
# Works across systems and architectures
BASHUNIT_PARALLEL_RUN=true ./bashunit
```
:::

### Validate exit codes

A new test ensures the `bashunit_exit_code` logic is correctly handled under different execution paths.

## 🌾 Miscellaneous

* Improved performance of internal `clock` utility
* Flexible argument handling in the installer
* Project overview added to the docs site
* CI jobs now split between macOS and Ubuntu
* Fixed minor typo in spy assertion message
